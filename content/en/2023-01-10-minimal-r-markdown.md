title: My Webinar on Explaining R Markdown with Minimal Applications
date: '2023-01-10'
slug: minimal-r-markdown
---

The ASA statistical computing section invited me to do a webinar today
(1:30-2:30pm CST). You can see the abstract on [the registration
page](https://uconn-cmr.webex.com/weblink/register/r1402166f1b250cd6c20315a6ec1aed62).
To some degree, it will be an odd talk, because I'm "going backwards" to talk
about the first generation of R Markdown. I don't expect this talk to benefit a
large audience, but I think I have got at least one interesting application in
the end. The talk will be quite technical (i.e., boring). Please try to come
half an hour late if you want to come anyway.

I'll update this post after I finish the webinar, which is one more reason why
you don't want to come to the webinar (you can read this post later without
missing much information). The talk will be recorded and available on Youtube
later.
